Rust code for calculating Dubin's Paths

Credit to [Andrew Walker](https://github.com/AndrewWalker) for the [original C code](https://github.com/AndrewWalker/Dubins-Curves)

I've ported the code to Rust and documented everything that I could understand. Documentation in the original repository was minimal.

## Quick example

```rust
use dubins_paths::{DubinsPath, PI, PosRot, Result as DubinsResult};

// PosRot represents the car's (Pos)ition and (Rot)ation
// Where x and y are the coordinates on a 2d plane
// and theta is the orientation of the car's front in radians

// The starting position and rotation
// PosRot::from_floats can also be used for const contexts
const q0: PosRot = PosRot::from_floats(0., 0., PI / 4.);

// The target end position and rotation
// PosRot implements From<[f32; 3]>
let q1 = [100., -100., PI * (3. / 4.)].into();

// The car's turning radius (must be > 0)
// This can be calculated by taking a cars angular velocity and dividing it by the car's forward velocity
// `turn radius = ang_vel / forward_vel`
let rho = 11.6;

// Calculate the shortest possible path between these two points with the given turning radius
let shortest_path_possible: DubinsResult<DubinsPath> = DubinsPath::shortest_from(q0, q1, rho);

// Assert that the path was found!
assert!(shortest_path_possible.is_ok());
```

DubinsPath has many methods you should look into, such as length, extract_subpath, sample, and sample_many.

## Features

* `std` - (Default) Enables the use of the standard library
* `alloc` - Enables `sample` and `sample_many` when `std` is disabled
* `libm` - Enables the use of the `libm` crate for mathematical functions
* `glam` - Use a [`glam`](https://crates.io/crates/glam) compatible API
* `f64` - By default, the library uses `f32` precision and the equivalent `glam::f32` structs if that feature is enabled. Setting `f64` changes all numbers to 64-bit precision, and uses `glam::f64` vector types
